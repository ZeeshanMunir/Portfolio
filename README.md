# Portfolio
I am a Mobile App Developer specializing in iOS application development and cross-platform mobile development using React Native. I focus on building scalable, high-performance mobile applications with strong attention to code quality, performance, and user experience.

My core technical expertise includes Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Objective-C, Xcode, and modern iOS frameworks, along with React Native for cross-platform solutions. I work with REST and GraphQL APIs, follow MVVM and Clean Architecture, and implement CI/CD workflows to support maintainable and production-ready mobile systems.

I have hands-on experience across the full mobile app development lifecycle, from requirements analysis and architecture design to implementation, optimization, testing, and deployment to the App Store. I collaborate closely with designers, product managers, and backend teams to deliver reliable and user-centric mobile applications.

I value clean, maintainable code, scalable architectures, and continuous improvement. I actively stay updated with the latest advancements in iOS development, React Native, and mobile engineering best practices, and I enjoy taking on new challenges that drive technical and product excellence.
